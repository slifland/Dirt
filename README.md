## Our Inspiration
While composting is highly encouraged at UVA, many students do not feel incentivized or do not have enough information about composting. **Around 580 million metric tons of methane are emitted annually, and humans contribute to many emissions.** Additionally, studies have shown that **composting instead of trashing could decrement methane emissions by up to eighty-four percent.** Why should we hover so seamlessly over such a significant topic? For this reason, we created “dirt”, a website that encourages students and faculty around campus to competitively compost to promote an eco-friendly environment and contribute to the ongoing issue of atmospheric pollution.

## How it Works
When students walk up to a compost bin, they should notice a QR code that redirects them to our website using their phone’s Camera app. Using our website, users can log in with their Google account, take a picture of the item they want to know is compostable or not, and dispose of the item properly to promote a healthy and clean environment. Specifically, our website provides information about the item’s compostability, why it is compostable/non-compostable, and special steps to compost/dispose the item (if necessary). Users who scan compostable items are awarded one point, contributing to their rank on our global leaderboard. We chose this approach because it promotes a competitive environment that encourages healthy habits amongst college students and faculty. We want everyone to have a role in contributing to a pollutant-free world while also having fun!
